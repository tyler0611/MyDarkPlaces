<p class="text-body" >Dear Sir,</p>
<div class="a">
<p class="text-body">I would suggest, in relation to your latest rape murder (that I read about in today&apos;s paper) you should question E. Ponce, a TV repair man, works for Dorn&apos;s, lives in Monterey Park. This is rather near El Monte and my wife charges that he raped her in April of last year, in my home. He also threatened her at that time and the rest of the family. Our matter is in the courts at this time. He is a tall slim Mexican, very pronounced accent. Make him account for his actions and or any others of a similar nature, as he is so inclined.</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p class="text-body">Ask Ponce if he was acquainted with the nurse that was raped &amp; murdered. Find out if she ever bought a TV or had other dealings with Dorn&apos;s, and if Ponce had ever repaired sets or any other appliance for her. Look at Dorn&apos;s books and hours. Make him account for his time on the night of the crime. Substantiated. Ask me to identify him, just as if I had seen her with him. Let me get a close look.</p>
